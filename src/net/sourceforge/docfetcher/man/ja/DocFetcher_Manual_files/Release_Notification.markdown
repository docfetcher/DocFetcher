Release Notification
====================
There are several ways for you to receive notification of new DocFetcher releases:

* ***Email via sourceforge.net***: On <http://sourceforge.net/projects/docfetcher>, there's an `Update Notifications` box, where you can enter your email address in order to receive release notifications.
* ***Email via freecode.com***: New DocFetcher releases are usually announced on <http://freecode.com>. To receive an email upon new releases, create an account on that website, go to the DocFetcher project at <http://freecode.com/projects/docfetcher> and subscribe to it by clicking on the "follow" button on the right.
* ***RSS***: If you prefer RSS, you can subscribe to our [file release feed](http://sourceforge.net/api/file/index/project-id/197779/mtime/desc/limit/20/rss).
* ***Firefox Addon***: If you're using Firefox, there's this nifty addon called [Update Scanner](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/update-scanner/), which allows you to monitor arbitrary websites. With this, you can monitor our [download page](http://docfetcher.sourceforge.net/download.html).
