Requirements
========================================
A Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 1.7 or higher, is required. To find
out what JRE version you have, open a command prompt and type in
"java -version". If Java 1.7 or higher is not available on your system, you
can obtain it in the following places:
- Windows: http://java.com
- Linux: In the official software repository of your distribution.
- OS X: http://java.com


How to start DocFetcher
========================================
Windows:
If DocFetcher was installed (i.e. non-portable), launch it via the DocFetcher
shortcut in your start menu. If you're instead using the portable version of
DocFetcher, double-click on DocFetcher.exe.
Note that portable DocFetcher may not work properly if you extract it into a
folder for which you don't have write permissions, e.g. into "C:\Program Files".

Linux:
Launch the program by double-clicking on DocFetcher-GTK2.sh or
DocFetcher-GTK3.sh. The difference between these two scripts is that
DocFetcher's user interface will be based either on GTK2 or on GTK3. With some
desktop environments, only GTK2 works, while with some others, only GTK3 works.
Thus, you'll have to try one script, and if DocFetcher doesn't start or the GUI
is behaving strangely, you'll have to try the other script.
If with either script DocFetcher doesn't start or a text editor shows up, make
sure the executable flag has been set on the respective file. If that doesn't
work either, you might see a helpful error mesage if you start the script from
from the terminal.

OS X:
Launch the program by double-clicking on the DocFetcher application bundle.
