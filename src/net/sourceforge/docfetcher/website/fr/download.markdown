Step 1: Install Java Runtime

A Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 1.7 or higher, is required. To find
out what JRE version you have, open a command prompt and type in
"java -version".

If Java 1.7 or higher is not available on your system, you can obtain it in
the following places:

* Windows: <https://java.com>
* Linux: In the official software repository of your distribution.
* OS&nbsp;X: <https://java.com>
