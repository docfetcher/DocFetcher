Known dependencies between the various libraries used:
- JUnRar depends on Javolution and Commons Logging
- Mime-Util depends on SLF4J
- TrueZIP depends on Commons Compress, Tukaani XZ Utils
- Apache POI depends on Commons Codec
- Apache PDFBox depends on Commons Logging
- Apache Tika depends on Commons IO

Additionally, PDFBox will crash with NoClassDefFoundErrors on encrypted PDF
files when using a version of bcmail and bcprov (Bouncy Castle libraries) that
is newer than 1.46. This is apparently due to changes in the API of bcmail and
bcprov.
