# The internal program settings are stored here.
# Only modify this file if you know what you're doing.
# 
# How to edit this file:
# * The program loads this file on startup and overwrites it
#   on closing. Thus, remember to close the program
#   before editing this file, otherwise all your changes
#   will get overwritten.
# * To restore the default value of an entry, close the
#   program, delete the entry, then restart the program. The
#   program will now use the default value and write it to
#   disk when it closes.
# * Clear or delete the entire file to restore all default
#   values.
