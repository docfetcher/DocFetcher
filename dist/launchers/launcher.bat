rem  Common modifications:
rem  1) Replace the "java" keyword in the last line with the full path to the
rem  Java executable.
rem  2) Give DocFetcher more memory with the setting -Xmx..m in the last line.
rem  For example, with -Xmx512m, DocFetcher will use up to 512 MB of memory.
rem  Using more memory than about 1 GB requires a 64-bit Java runtime.
