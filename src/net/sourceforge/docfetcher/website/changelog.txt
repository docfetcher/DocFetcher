==== 2016-07-25 - DocFetcher 1.1.18 ====

=== Features ===
  * Indexes can now be named.
  * Improved OpenOffice/LibreOffice indexing and text preview.
  * Partial French translation of website.
  * Partial Japanese translation of GUI and manual.

=== Bugfixes ===
  * IndexOutOfBoundsException crash on some MS Office files (bug #1200 and others).
  * Fixed an indexing crash on Linux with GNOME 3 desktop.
  * If an index was added while all existing indexes were unchecked, results from the new index weren't shown until the unchecked indexes were reselected or the program was restarted.
  * The previous Linux launcher didn't work on some Linux distributions. Because of that, the Linux launcher was split into DocFetcher-GTK2.sh and DocFetcher-GTK3.sh. On some Linux distributions only the first one works, on some others only the second one works, so you may have to try both.
  * Customizing the indexes path in the misc/paths.txt file didn't work in the non-portable version of DocFetcher.
  * In the previous version, DocFetcher could fill the desktop with hundreds of crash windows. Now the number of simultaneously shown crash windows is limited to 5.

  * Increased the default width of the search field from 200 to 500 pixels. To set a different width, edit the Advanced Settings file.
  * The tabs on the indexing dialog now have a different look.
  * Reorganized the contents of the Advanced Settings file. (The change won't be visible if you install a new non-portable version over an existing non-portable version.)

=== Changes ===
  * Raised the required minimum version for the Java runtime from 1.6 to 1.7 (necessary for the improved CHM and MP3 support).
